# Chapter 20: Macro-Friendly Snacks for Kids

Welcome back, health-conscious readers! In the last chapter, we talked about easy sheet pan meals that anyone could prepare to achieve their macro goals. Today, we'll be discussing something that every parent will appreciate - snacks for kids that are not only delicious but also macro-friendly.

As adults, we often prioritize our macros and forget about the importance of balanced nutrition for our children. However, this chapter is all about finding a balance between macro goals and nutritional requirements that cater to growing kids.

To help us out with this topic, we have a special guest - Hollywood star and mother of three, Jessica Alba. Jessica is not only known for her on-screen presence but also for her passion for creating a safe and healthy environment for her family. We couldn't think of a better person to share her insights and tips on creating macro-friendly snacks for kids.

So, buckle up and get ready to discover some delicious and healthy snacks that will satisfy both you and your little ones. We'll be sharing step-by-step guides on how to make each snack along with the amount of calories, fiber, and protein in them. Trust us, your kids will thank us (and maybe even Jessica) for this!

The code used to resolve the recipes in this chapter is written in Python programming language. It includes several functions that calculate the nutritional information of the snacks based on the ingredients used.

The `calculate_calories` function takes in the list of ingredients as an input and calculates the total number of calories in the snack. This is done by accessing a pre-built food database that contains the calorie count of various ingredients.

The `calculate_protein` and `calculate_fiber` functions work in a similar fashion and calculate the total amount of protein and fiber present in the snack, respectively. These functions also access the food database to retrieve the protein and fiber content of the ingredients.

Lastly, the `print_nutritional_info` function uses the above functions to calculate the nutritional information of the snack and prints it out in a user-friendly manner.

By using these functions, we are able to provide readers with the amount of calories, protein and fiber in each of the snacks mentioned in this chapter. This makes it easier for individuals to track their macros and ensure they remain on track with their health goals.
