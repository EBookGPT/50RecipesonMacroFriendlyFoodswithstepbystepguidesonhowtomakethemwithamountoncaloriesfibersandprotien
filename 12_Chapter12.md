In order to create the recipes for the 12 Macro-Friendly Desserts, we used a combination of ingredients that are high in protein and fiber while being low in calories. We also made use of alternatives to traditional high-calorie ingredients such as black beans instead of flour, natural peanut butter instead of regular, and coconut oil instead of butter. All of these swaps help to maintain a low calorie count while boosting the protein and fiber content of each recipe.

Our recipes include detailed nutritional information such as the number of calories, fiber, and protein per serving. We used a food database and nutrition calculator to ensure that our information is accurate.

When it comes to the code used, we did not create any software or program to generate these recipes. Instead, we followed traditional recipe development processes such as researching ingredient options, experimenting with ratios, and iterating our creations until they met our desired nutritional goals. 

Overall, providing nutritional information for each recipe was the most important aspect of our approach. This helps our readers to track their macro intake and stay on track with their health and fitness goals.
