The recipes for Macro-Friendly Drinks and Smoothies are presented in a markdown format to make it easy to follow and understand. In order to create these recipes, there is no code involved. However, it is important to note that recipes can be converted into code in the form of programming functions, which is sometimes useful when working with nutritional information and calculations.

For example, a program that calculates the number of macronutrients in a recipe could take user input for the ingredients and amounts, and output the total calories, protein, and fiber. This could be done using mathematical formulas and nutritional data.

In addition, some recipe websites and apps use code to dynamically adjust the serving size and quantities based on user input. This allows users to easily adjust the recipe for their specific nutritional needs and preferences.

While these types of programs and tools can be helpful, it's important to remember that manually tracking macros and using a food scale for precise measurements is still the most accurate way to track and meet your nutritional goals.
