To provide calorie, fiber, and protein information for each recipe, we used a simple nutrition calculator Python script that takes in the weight of each ingredient and the number of servings and calculates the nutritional information per serving.

To do this, we first defined a dictionary to hold the nutritional value for each ingredient per gram. For example, we defined the nutritional value of grilled chicken breast as 0.165 calories per gram, 0.032 grams of fiber per gram, and 0.032 grams of protein per gram.

```
nutritional_value = {
	'grilled_chicken_breast': {'calories': 0.165, 'fiber': 0.032, 'protein': 0.032},
	'romaine_lettuce': {'calories': 0.016, 'fiber': 0.013, 'protein': 0.001},
	'parmesan_cheese': {'calories': 0.45, 'fiber': 0, 'protein': 0.039},
	... # Nutritional value for each ingredient
}
```

Then, we created a function called `calculate_nutrition` that takes in the ingredient list and quantity for each ingredient. This function iterates through each ingredient and looks up its nutritional value in the `nutritional_value` dictionary. Then, it calculates the total calories, fiber, and protein for the recipe by summing up the nutritional value for each ingredient based on its weight.

```
def calculate_nutrition(ingredients, quantities, serving_size):
	calories, fiber, protein = 0, 0, 0
	
	for i, ingredient in enumerate(ingredients):
		weight = quantities[i]
		ingredient_nutrition = nutritional_value[ingredient]
		calories += weight * ingredient_nutrition['calories']
		fiber += weight * ingredient_nutrition['fiber']
		protein += weight * ingredient_nutrition['protein']
	
	calories_per_serving = calories / serving_size
	fiber_per_serving = fiber / serving_size
	protein_per_serving = protein / serving_size
	
	return {'calories': calories_per_serving, 'fiber': fiber_per_serving, 'protein': protein_per_serving}
```

We used this function for each recipe to calculate the nutritional information per serving and displayed it alongside the ingredient list and instructions. With this information, readers can make informed choices about what they eat and ensure they are meeting their dietary goals.
