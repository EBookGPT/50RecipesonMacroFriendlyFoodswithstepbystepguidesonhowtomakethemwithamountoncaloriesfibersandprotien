# Chapter 5: Protein-Packed Breakfasts

Welcome to the fifth chapter of our book, "50 Recipes on Macro Friendly Foods with step by step guides on how to make them with an amount on calories, fiber, and protein." After the flavorful soups and stews in the previous chapter, it is time to dive into some protein-packed breakfasts!

Consuming protein in the morning is crucial for overall health and weight management. Not only does it promote muscle growth and repair, but it also keeps us full for longer periods, preventing overeating throughout the day.

In this chapter, we present five delicious recipes that are packed with protein to kick-start your day. From classic omelets to hearty breakfast bowls, these meals are designed to keep you energized and focused throughout the day.

As always, our recipes are macro-friendly and come with step-by-step instructions on how to prepare them, along with calories, fiber, and protein content. So, grab your aprons and let's get cooking!

For this chapter, we have provided the code for each recipe to help you easily calculate the calories, fiber, and protein content of each dish.

We have used Python, a popular programming language, to write the code for these recipes. The code is designed to take the quantities of each ingredient and calculate their corresponding macronutrient values.

Here is an example function that calculates the calories, protein, and fiber content of an omelet recipe:

```python
def calculate_omelet_macros(eggs, cheese, veggies):
    """
    Calculates the macronutrient content of a three egg omelet with cheese and veggies.

    Args:
        eggs (float): The number of eggs used.
        cheese (float): The amount of cheese used in grams.
        veggies (list): A list of vegetables used and their corresponding weights in grams.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the total calories, protein, and fiber content of the omelet.
    """
    # Calculate calories from eggs, cheese, and veggies
    egg_calories = eggs * 70
    cheese_calories = cheese * 113
    veggie_calories = sum([veggie[1] * veggie[2] for veggie in veggies]) / 100

    # Calculate protein from eggs and cheese
    egg_protein = eggs * 6
    cheese_protein = cheese * 7

    # Calculate fiber from veggies
    veggie_fiber = sum([veggie[1] * veggie[3] for veggie in veggies]) / 100

    # Calculate total calories, protein, and fiber
    total_calories = egg_calories + cheese_calories + veggie_calories
    total_protein = egg_protein + cheese_protein
    total_fiber = veggie_fiber

    return (total_calories, total_protein, total_fiber)
```

This code takes in the number of eggs, amount of cheese, and a list of veggies with their corresponding weights and calculates the total calories, protein, and fiber content of the omelet.

We have used a similar format for each recipe in this chapter to help you easily calculate the macronutrient values of each dish. Happy cooking!
