# Chapter 21: Gluten-Free Macro-Friendly Recipes

Welcome to the 21st chapter of "50 Recipes on Macro Friendly Foods with step by step guides on how to make them with amount on calories fibers and protein." In this chapter, we'll be exploring gluten-free recipes that are both macro-friendly and delicious. And to help us create some of these amazing recipes, we have an esteemed guest, Elizabeth Hasselbeck!

In this chapter, Elizabeth will be sharing some of her favorite gluten-free recipes that are macro-friendly and easy to make. From breakfast to dessert, we've got you covered with a variety of recipes that will tantalize your taste buds and fit in with your macro-friendly meal plan.

We'll provide detailed step-by-step instructions on how to make each recipe, including nutritional information such as calories, fiber, and protein content. Eating gluten-free doesn't have to be a challenge when you have the right ingredients and recipes!

Let's roll up our sleeves and get cooking with Elizabeth Hasselbeck as our special guest for this chapter of the book. Get ready to impress your taste buds while maintaining your macro-friendly meal plan!
To provide macro and nutrition information for each recipe in this chapter, we'll be using a Python code that calculates the number of calories, protein, and fiber in each ingredient and the entire recipe. Here's an explanation of the code used to resolve the nutritional content for each recipe:

```
# Function to calculate nutritional value of an ingredient
def calculate_nutrition(name, weight, calories, protein, fiber):
    total_calories = (weight/100)*calories
    total_protein = (weight/100)*protein
    total_fiber = (weight/100)*fiber
    return {'ingredient': name, 'calories': total_calories, 'protein': total_protein, 'fiber': total_fiber}

# Function to calculate nutritional value of a recipe
def calculate_recipe_nutrition(ingredients):
    total_calories = 0
    total_protein = 0
    total_fiber = 0
    for ingredient in ingredients:
        total_calories += ingredient['calories']
        total_protein += ingredient['protein']
        total_fiber += ingredient['fiber']
    return {'calories': total_calories, 'protein': total_protein, 'fiber': total_fiber}

```

The `calculate_nutrition` function takes in the name of the ingredient, its weight in grams, the number of calories, protein, and fiber per 100 grams and calculates the total number of calories, protein, and fiber in the ingredient using simple math. It then returns a dictionary with the name of the ingredient, along with its nutritional values.

The `calculate_recipe_nutrition` function takes in a list of ingredients, loops through each ingredient in the list, and calls the `calculate_nutrition` function for each ingredient. It then calculates the total number of calories, protein, and fiber for the entire recipe by adding up the values for each ingredient and returning a dictionary with the nutritional values of the entire recipe.

Using this code, we're able to provide accurate and detailed nutritional information for each recipe in the chapter, making it easier for readers to maintain their macro-friendly meal plan while still enjoying delicious gluten-free meals.
