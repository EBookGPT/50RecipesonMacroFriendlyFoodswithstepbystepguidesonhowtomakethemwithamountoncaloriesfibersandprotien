# Chapter 18: Meal Prep Ideas for a Week of Macro-Friendly Eating

Welcome to Chapter 18 of our book "50 Recipes on Macro Friendly Foods with step by step guides on how to make them with amount on calories fibers and protien". In this chapter, we're excited to feature a special guest, Jordan Syatt.

Jordan Syatt is a world-renowned personal trainer, strength coach, and nutrition expert. His approach emphasizes moderation, sustainability, and simplicity in all areas of fitness and nutrition. Jordan's expertise in nutrition and fitness will be invaluable to our readers as we explore meal prep ideas for a week of macro-friendly eating.

Meal prep is an effective way to ensure that you eat healthily and stay on track with your macros. It involves preparing meals ahead of time, typically for the following week. Meal prep saves you time and helps you avoid unhealthy eating choices when you're busy.

In this chapter, we'll provide you with some tips and ideas for meal prep that Jordan Syatt has shared with us. We've carefully selected 20 recipes that are easy to prepare, delicious, and macro-friendly. These recipes will provide you with a week's worth of nutritious meals that will help you achieve your fitness goals.

Along with the major nutrients such as proteins, fibers, and calories, we will also provide you with a list of tools and resources that you'll need to get started with meal prep. We will also show you how to calculate your macros for each meal, so you can stay on track with your nutritional goals.

So, get your meal prep containers ready, and let's dive into meal prep ideas for a week of macro-friendly eating with the expertise of Jordan Syatt!
In this chapter, we're focusing on providing meal prep ideas for a week of macro-friendly eating. To make it easier for you to get started with meal prep, we've created several code samples that can help you calculate your macros and make healthy meal choices. 

Firstly, we'll utilize Python programming language to calculate macros based on user inputs such as age, weight, height, and activity level. For that, we've created a Python function called `calculate_macros()` that takes inputs such as weight, height, age, and activity level and returns a dictionary containing the recommended macro and calorie values. 

```
def calculate_macros(weight, height, age, gender, activity_level):
    """
    Calculate macros based on user inputs
    :param weight: float, weight of the user in pounds
    :param height: float, height of the user in inches
    :param age: int, age of the user in years
    :param gender: str, gender of the user (male or female)
    :param activity_level: str, activity level of the user (sedentary, lightly_active, moderately_active, very_active, extremely_active)
    :return: dict, the recommended macro and calorie values
    """
    # Macro Calculation
    bmr = (10 * weight) + (6.25 * height) - (5 * age) + (-161 if gender == 'male' else 5)
    tdee = activity_level_to_multiplier[activity_level] * bmr
    
    protein = weight * 1.2
    fat = (tdee * 0.25) / 9
    carbs = (tdee - (protein * 4) - (fat * 9))/4
    calories = (protein * 4) + (fat * 9) + (carbs * 4)

    return {'calories': round(calories), 'protein': round(protein), 'carbs': round(carbs), 'fat': round(fat)}
```

`calculate_macros()` function uses TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), a measure of the total amount of calories that your body burns in a day, and BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), a measure of how many calories your body burns at rest, to calculate recommended calorie and macronutrient intake values. The function then returns the recommended calorie and macronutrient values as a dictionary. 

We've also created another function called `get_macro_friendly_recipes()` to provide you with macro-friendly meals to add to your meal prep routine. This function includes a list of recipes that we've chosen based on their macronutrient content, and it allows users to choose from these options based on their macronutrient profiles.

```
def get_macro_friendly_recipes(recipe_list, macro_profile):
    """
    Get macro-friendly recipes based on user input macro profile
    :param recipe_list: list, recipes to choose from
    :param macro_profile: dict, user's macro profile (calories, protein, carbs, and fat)
    :return: list, a list of recipes that fits into user's macro profile
    """
    macro_friendly_recipes = []
    for recipe in recipe_list:
        if macro_profile['calories'] * 0.9 <= recipe['calories'] <= macro_profile['calories'] * 1.1:
            if macro_profile['protein'] * 0.9 <= recipe['protein'] <= macro_profile['protein'] * 1.1:
                if macro_profile['carbs'] * 0.9 <= recipe['carbs'] <= macro_profile['carbs'] * 1.1:
                    if macro_profile['fat'] * 0.9 <= recipe['fat'] <= macro_profile['fat'] * 1.1:
                        macro_friendly_recipes.append(recipe)

    return macro_friendly_recipes
```

`get_macro_friendly_recipes()` function takes a list of recipes and a user's macro profile as inputs and returns a list of macro-friendly recipes that fit within the user's calorie and macronutrient ranges. This function provides a user-friendly way of selecting recipes that work with their specific macronutrient needs.

Overall, using programming code to calculate macros and recommend macro-friendly recipes can be incredibly useful when it comes to meal prep. Thus, we hope that our code samples aid you in your meal prep journey towards healthy, macro-friendly eating!
