Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have access to the actual code used to develop the 50 Recipes on Macro Friendly Foods. However, I can suggest some common code snippets that can be used to develop Sheet Pan Meals recipes with their nutritional information.

Calculating the nutritional information of a recipe requires a few important variables such as the weight, calories, protein, and fiber content of all the ingredients used. You can use tools such as the USDA Food Data Central to obtain accurate nutritional information about most food items.

In Python, you can use the following code snippet to calculate the nutritional value of a recipe:

```
from pandas import DataFrame

# Nutritional values of ingredients (per 100gm)
ingredients = {
    'chicken': { 'calories': 165, 'protein': 31, 'fiber': 0 },
    'broccoli': { 'calories': 34, 'protein': 3, 'fiber': 2.6 },
    'sweet potato': { 'calories': 86, 'protein': 1.6, 'fiber': 3 },
    'olive oil': { 'calories': 884, 'protein': 0, 'fiber': 0 }
}

# Recipe ingredient list (in grams)
recipe = {
    'chicken': 150,
    'broccoli': 100,
    'sweet potato': 200,
    'olive oil': 15
}

# Calculate the total nutritional value of recipe
total_calories = sum([ingredients[i]['calories']*recipe[i]/100 for i in recipe])
total_protein = sum([ingredients[i]['protein']*recipe[i]/100 for i in recipe])
total_fiber = sum([ingredients[i]['fiber']*recipe[i]/100 for i in recipe])

# Creating data frame from the calculated data
data = {'Nutrients': ['Calories', 'Protein', 'Fiber'], 'Values': [total_calories, total_protein, total_fiber]}
df = DataFrame(data)

# Display the nutritional information
print(df)
```

This code will take the weight of each ingredient used in a recipe, the nutritional value of each ingredient (per 100 grams), and then calculate the total nutritional value of the recipe. The output will be displayed as a data frame with the total amount of calories, protein, and fiber in the recipe.

In conclusion, by using mathematical calculations combined with accurate information about the nutritional value of each ingredient, you can easily calculate the nutritional information of any recipe and customize it to meet your macro-friendly diet needs.
