In this chapter, we are discussing meal planning for macro-friendly foods. While we won't be providing specific code blocks, there are several tools out there that can help you with meal planning and tracking your macros.

One example is the MyFitnessPal app, which allows you to set your macros and track your daily food intake to ensure that you are staying within your target ranges. The app has a comprehensive database of foods and their nutritional information, so you can quickly log what you're eating and see how it affects your macros and calorie intake.

Another useful tool is a meal planning app like Mealime or Prepear. These apps offer personalized meal plans based on your dietary preferences and provide recipes and grocery lists to make meal planning as streamlined as possible. They also include nutritional information for each recipe, so you can be confident that you're hitting your macro targets.

When it comes to meal prepping, there are a few basic steps that can be followed to make the process more efficient. These include:

1. Identify the recipes you want to make for the week
2. Create a grocery list based on the necessary ingredients
3. Shop for groceries
4. Prep the ingredients - cooking any uncooked components, like chicken breast, and chopping up vegetables
5. Store prepared components in the fridge or freezer to use as needed throughout the week

While these tools and tips aren't a replacement for solid nutritional knowledge, they can be helpful in making the process of meal planning and tracking macros easier and more convenient.
